      <p>From the dawn of modernity through the eras of colonialism, decolonization, and post-colonial imperialism — including the ideological divisions of the Cold War and the rise of Islamophobia following the September 11 attacks — Muslim communities worldwide have faced a broad spectrum of political, social, and humanitarian challenges.</p>
      <p>Some issues have seen partial resolution, while others persist and produce profound consequences for millions. The list below highlights six of the most pressing contemporary issues.</p>

      <h2 id="palestinians-heading">1. The Palestinians</h2>
      <p>Between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea lies Palestine — a land where Arab Muslims historically lived alongside Christian and Jewish minorities for centuries. The political equilibrium shifted as modern Zionist movements emerged in the late nineteenth century, followed by the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration">Balfour Declaration</a></em> of 1917 and the British military campaign that took Jerusalem in 1918.</p>
      <p>The decisive turning point occurred with the <strong>Nakba</strong> ("Catastrophe") of 1948, when the establishment of the State of Israel led to mass displacement of Palestinian Arabs. Since then, millions have lived as refugees or in diaspora, experiencing long-term occupation, statelessness, and repeated humanitarian crises.</p>

      <h2 id="uyghurs-heading">2. The Uyghur People of Xinjiang, China</h2>
      <p>The Uyghurs are a Turkic-speaking Muslim people native to China’s Xinjiang Autonomous Region. In recent decades, reports by scholars and international groups document <em>mass detentions</em>, intensive surveillance, restrictions on religious practice, and policies aimed at cultural assimilation.</p>
      <p>The crisis raises critical questions about human rights, religious freedom, and the preservation of minority identity under modern nation-state policies.</p>

    <article id="rohingya" class="card" aria-labelledby="rohingya-heading">
      <h2 id="rohingya-heading">3. The Rohingya Crisis</h2>
      <p>The Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar are widely considered one of the most persecuted minorities globally. Although many Rohingya have lived in Rakhine State for generations, they have been denied citizenship and civil rights by Myanmar’s authorities.</p>
      <p>Since 2017, military operations that the United Nations has characterized in strong terms have displaced hundreds of thousands into refugee camps in Bangladesh and beyond. The Rohingya crisis exemplifies issues of ethnic nationalism, statelessness, and religious intolerance.</p>

      <h2 id="western-heading">4. Muslims in Western Societies</h2>
      <p>Muslim communities in Western countries contribute substantially to civic, cultural, and economic life. Yet many face Islamophobia, discrimination, and media stereotyping — especially since 2001 — which affect social inclusion and representation.</p>
      <p>Debates over multiculturalism versus assimilation continue to influence public policy and everyday experiences of Muslim citizens and residents across Western democracies.</p>

      <h2 id="indian-heading">5. Indian Muslims</h2>
      <p>India is home to one of the world’s largest Muslim populations. Despite deep historical ties to the subcontinent’s culture and politics, Indian Muslims face challenges including socio-political marginalization, episodes of communal violence, and discriminatory practices.</p>
      <p>Incidents of mob violence, legal disputes over citizenship and rights, and rising communal tensions have contributed to fears of systemic exclusion among many Indian Muslims.</p>

    <article id="refugees" class="card" aria-labelledby="refugees-heading">
      <h2 id="refugees-heading">6. Muslim Refugees Worldwide</h2>
      <p>Conflicts and instability in regions such as Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Sudan have produced millions of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Many live in precarious conditions with limited access to basic services like education, healthcare, and safe shelter.</p>
      <p>The global refugee crisis highlights gaps in international protection and burden-sharing, while Muslim refugees often contend with both displacement and discrimination in host communities.</p>
